				When Matthew Weber and I began researching mobile payments, we wanted to better understand the space and uncover people’s motivations for using their phones to pay for things in stores. What we found was more tangential to financial transactions than we’d expected. 

			</p>
				<p>Our first survey showed that coffee was the most common purchase, and we were surprised to discover that Starbucks accounted for most of those purchases. That struck us as an interesting finding. What could we find out if we dug a little deeper? Could we not only answer Ion’s question of why people use mobile payments, but also, why Starbucks? If we could understand that, then we could offer lessons that would help others mimic the popularity of the Starbucks app.

			</p>

			<p>

				A follow-up survey of 100 people helped us to explore what specifically motivates Starbucks app users. Starbucks has found the key to brand devotion among its customers, and it’s not just the caffeine. The app has a winning combination of rewards and convenience. 

			</p>
			<p>
				<h2>Survey Findings</h2>

		

				<h3> It's All About Rewards and Convenience</h3>

				<p>The reasons users gave most for using the Starbucks app were its ease of use and convenience, with <b>67% of users saying they liked the app because of those things.</b> But there’s more to it than ease and convenience. </p>
				<ul>
					<li>Rewards, such as earning free drinks or song downloads, are a huge incentive. <b>Eighty-four percent of respondents use the rewards feature</b> and <b>almost half downloaded the app simply because of the rewards.</b> Twenty-seven percent also used the app to get free songs.</li>
				</ul>
			</p>

		<h3  class="no-chapter">Reasons for Downloading the App</h3>

			<p>
				<img src="images/reasons_graphic.jpeg" class="img-responsive" />
			</p>


			<p>That alone doesn’t bring and keep these users. After all, users could still earn rewards by using a Starbucks card in stores. <b>Forty-six percent of Starbucks app users had had a loyalty card for less than a year and 21% had no loyalty card at all before downloading the app.</b> So, these users were more enticed by rewards after using the app. This brings us back to our original conclusion.
			</p>
			<ul>
				<li>Mobile payments help people to carry less — and that ability combined with the rewards — drives users back to the app time and time again. Starbucks cards are a popular gift, but it’s a burden to carry around multiple cards; the app means easily having access to them at all times. Nearly all, <b>91%, of the people who responded to our survey said they would stick with Starbucks even if they could pay with another app.</b> Those rewards are truly sustaining that customer loyalty. </li>
			</ul>

<h3>Starbucks App Users Are Fans</h3>
				<p>The level of loyalty we found among Starbucks’ customers was impressive. Not only do people use the Starbucks app, they actually enjoy it. When asked to review the app, <b>43% of users gave it five stars and 48% gave it four stars.</b> 


					
						The users surveyed were frequent patrons of the coffee shop as well as users of the app, with <b>61% having visited Starbucks in the last week</b> and <b>84% of users having used the app for their most recent purchase.</b>

								<p>It's simply more convenient than digging through my purse/wallet for my physical gold card. It also has other perks: telling me how many rewards points I have, the store locator feature, balance display, etc.</p>
							</blockquote>


							<blockquote><p>I love that I don't have to use my debit card for every purchase. I love how easy it is to reload the card, and how I get bonus points for using my card.</p>	</blockquote>

<h3>Brands Can Replicate Starbucks' Success </h3>




			<p>So what opportunities are there for other companies based on Starbucks’ experience with its app? Get rid of the paper rewards card and integrate rewards into a mobile payment app that brings convenience to consumers.
</p>
<p>
				<img src="images/cards.jpg" class="img-responsive" />
			</p>
			<p>Could we build the same level of support of Starbucks consumers for other brands that don’t have the means to build and maintain their own mobile app? Many stores already have a rewards program in the form of paper stamp cards. But customers don’t want to carry more cards. Paper rewards cards are destructible, forgettable, pile up and become burdensome to carry. 
</p>

<p>Mobile payments are most frequently used for small, common purchases. Other purchases that users most commonly made using an app:
</p>
<ul>
<li>food (66%)</li>	
<li>gas (37%</li>
<li>transportation (30%)</li>
</ul>

<p>Other businesses should seek to emulate Starbucks’ example in order to build their own customers’ loyalty. </p>

<h3>Primary Features from the Starbucks App</h3>
&nbsp;
<img src="images/starbucksapp.png" class="img-responsive" />
&nbsp;
<p>These are the top three features integral to the success of the app.
</p>
<ul>
<li>
Rewards. The Starbucks app’s home screen clearly displays users’ progress toward their next reward level along with other currently available freebies. Making sure that users understand the specific rewards they’ll receive rather than a reward level would improve the experience. Rewards must be central to any business trying to increase use of its app.</li>

<li>Payment. <b>Eighty percent of survey respondents use the Starbucks app to pay.</b> Multiple gift cards can be stored in the account to be used for payment. Users appreciate being able to reload cards or transfer balances between cards. Making payment easy through the app is key to making it convenient for users. </li>

<li>Menu. <b>Forty-six percent of Starbucks users consulted the menu in the app. </b>While not every business will need a menu, the information most relevant to a business’s customers needs to be easy to find and use. </li>
</ul>

<h3>Applying Rewards to Other Apps</h3>
<p>Starbucks has had success with mobile payments by building an app that makes it easy for its users to do the things they want to do and by incentivizing their return through rewards. The model they have created can be translated to many other types of businesses, with room for improvement, simplification, and of course customization based on the specific industry. 
</p>

<h3>Uber: Rewards for Riding</h3>
<p>We reimagined the home screen of the app, Uber, with can’t-miss rewards. 
</p>
 <img src="images/uber_callouts.png" class="img-responsive" />
&nbsp;
<p>		
<b>1. Communicate the value of rewards.</b> Users can easily see what is required to earn a reward and how far along they are to reaching that reward. </p>

<p><b>2. Improve convenience.</b> The home screen makes it easier for users to get a sense of how much their ride will cost; clearer language clarifies types of available cars; and ordering a car can be completed on one screen.</p>



<h3>Dispatcher: Rewards for News  </h3>
<p>Here’s a look at how a news app, Dispatcher, might incorporate rewards in order to encourage users to use the app. </p>
 <img src="images/dispatcher_rewards.png" class="img-responsive" />
&nbsp;
<p>		
<b>1. Rewards dominate home screen real estate.</b> Users can interact with their rewards on the top half of the screen and are informed about how to get to another reward.</p>
<p>
<b>2. Calls to action.</b>The actions most useful to users are displayed as the next most important feature.</p>


<h3>Conclusion</h3>
<p>If customer loyalty is one of the ultimate goals of a brand, Starbucks has struck gold. But it’s not unique to the coffee chain — rewards and convenience can be the keys to success for everyone.  </p>
