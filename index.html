					<h1 class="page-header no-chapter">Follow Starbucks’ Yellow Brick Road
					</h1>
					<p>
						When Matthew Weber and I began researching mobile payments, we wanted to better understand the space and uncover people’s motivations for using their phones to pay for things in stores. What we found was more tangential to financial transactions than we’d expected. 

					</p>
					<h2 id="testid">LESSONS FROM COFFEE</h2>
					<p>
						Our first survey showed that coffee was the most common purchase, and we were surprised to discover that Starbucks accounted for most of those purchases. That was an interesting finding that made us want to dig deeper. Could we not only answer Ion’s question of why people use mobile payments, but also, why Starbucks? If we could understand that, then we could offer lessons that would help others mimic the popularity of the Starbucks app.

					</p>
					<h2>It's All About Rewards and Convenience</h2>

					<p>

						A follow-up survey of 100 people helped us to explore what specifically motivates Starbucks app users. Starbucks has found the key to brand devotion among its customers, and it’s not just the caffeine. The app has a winning combination of rewards and convenience. 

					</p>
					<p>
						<h2>Survey Findings</h2>

						<h3>Starbucks App Users Are Fans</h3>
						<p>The level of loyalty we found among Starbucks’ customers was impressive. Not only do people use the Starbucks app, they actually enjoy it. When asked to review the app, <b>43% of users gave it five stars and 48% gave it four stars.</b> 

						</p>
						<p>
							The users surveyed were frequent patrons of the coffee shop as well as users of the app, with <b>61% having visited Starbucks in the last week</b> and <b>84% of users having used the app for their most recent purchase.</b> 


						</p>

<h2> A Majority of Users Utilize the Rewards Feature</h2>
<p>The reasons users gave most for using the app were its ease of use and convenience, with <b>67% of users saying they liked the app because of those things.</b> But there’s more to it than ease and convenience. </p>
<p>Rewards, such as earning free drinks or song downloads, are a huge incentive. <b>Eighty-four percent of respondents use the rewards feature</b> and <b>almost half downloaded the app simply because of the rewards.</b>b> Twenty-seven percent also used the app to get free songs.
</p>
<p>That alone doesn’t bring and keep these users. After all, users could still earn rewards by using a Starbucks card in stores. <b>Forty-six percent of Starbucks app users had had a loyalty card for less than a year and 21% had no loyalty card at all before downloading the app.</b> So, these users were more enticed by rewards after using the app. This brings us back to our original conclusion.
</p>
<p>Mobile payments help people to carry less — and that ability combined with the rewards — drives users back to the app time and time again. Starbucks cards are a popular gift, but it’s a burden to carry around multiple cards; the app means easily having access to them at all times. Nearly all, <b>91%, of the people who responded to our survey said they would stick with Starbucks even if they could pay with another app.</b> Those rewards are truly sustaining that customer loyalty. </p>

						<h2 class="no-chapter">Big Opportunity for &ldquo;Online Calculators&rdquo;</h2>

						<p>To discover what could be used to drive traffic to my app, I used Google’s Keyword Planner tool, which shows how often users search for particular search terms, and what degree of competition there is to reach these users. I found a high degree of search activity around "online calculators" – over 800,000 monthly searches – with a low level of competition. Compared to "spreadsheet" which has only 100,000 monthly searches, "calculator" presents an untapped opportunity.</p>
						<p>It became clear that there was an opportunity to tap into this search traffic, by creating specific landing pages targeting a large variety of vertical markets and niche uses, such as "online sales calculator", "online revenue calculator", "estimate calculator" and so on. </p>

						<h2 class="no-chapter">Competitors Are Built for Collaboration, Not for Making Spreadsheets Look Good</h2>
						<p>
							In the last few years, developers have added a lot of social features into spreadsheets, making it easier to share raw data. However, there has been little focus on the presentation spreadsheets – something that can tell the story behind the data. 
						</p>
						<p>
							For example, if a user has a quick calculation and sends it off to a client or other department, it is typically copy and pasted from Excel into some other application such as PowerPoint. While this is the easiest thing to do right now, it <b>renders the data dead</b>, unable to be explored by the user. This flies in the face of growing demand by a data audience who want to explore data themselves, as opposed to being handed static PowerPoints (footnote to Brendan Doohan).

						<h2  class="no-chapter">Demonstrating Value: Instant Styling</h2>
						<p>
							With extremely entrenched competition like Excel, <b>my app needed to prove its value instantly</b> to users when they first encounter it. Since the research showed that <B>users need to make their spreadsheets look good</b> and that formatting that data was time consuming, I decided to tackle a baseline of making it 20x faster for users to present their data.  
						</p>
						<p>
							<b>The spreadsheet would "suck in" the style of any website by giving it a URL.</b> For example, if a user put in "www.apple.com", the application would suck in and apply the typography, images, layout, etc to the aforementioned spreadsheet. The actual application of the style would be accomplished by a combination of computer-readable style elements, heuristics, and human workers behind the scenes.
						</p>




						<h2  class="no-chapter">Generating Traffic: Calculator Landing Pages</h2>
						<p>
							Leveraging the keyword research earlier on, the app would have <i>hundreds</i> of different landing pages for all sorts of verticals that may need a predefined "calculator" that can be styled for their unique needs.
						</p>

						<h2  class="no-chapter">Monetization: Pay to Lock It Down</h2>
						<p>
							The application will be free to use and to share data with. By the presentation-nature of the application, the more viral it is, then more successful it will be. However, due also to the sensitive nature of business data, there are many cases where users may want to "lock it down", that is, require some level of password clearance. This is where the app can be monetized – offering enterprise-level security to the app by subscription. The security subscription can make sure only authenticated users can view presentations, and can integrated with single-signon technologies.
						</p>		


						<h1 class="page-header">Prototype</h1>
						<p>Usability is a high-level goal for the application, and so several rounds of prototypes were created to run usability tests with. The first prototype was a raw paper-based prototype, on which to test my initial assumptions. After applying lessons learned from the first prototype, I quickly iterated and built a more refined interactive prototype.</p>

								<h1 class="page-header no-chapter">Making it Real</h1>
								<p>It was clear from my initial survey that <b>users need their spreadsheets to look good</b>, which drove the rest of the project to build an app where users could beautifully style their spreadsheets for presentation, ridiculously fast. What was left was to build wireframes as a specification for developers, and to refine the prototype once more.</p>
								<h2  class="no-chapter">Future Steps</h2>
								<p>The next steps for production, would be to generate the landing pages to make sure the traffic hypothesis is correct, as this is a testable assumption without even the application. Assuming enough traffic is generated, the first public version would be generated. The "instant design" would start off with humans behind the scenes, actually assembling the pages. This is to identify patterns as to which elements are easiest to automate. This does mean a slow styling feature in the beginning, but it allows us to see what design challenges actually come up in the wild first.</p>
